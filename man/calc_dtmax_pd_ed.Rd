\arguments{
\item{vctr_time}{A timestamp vector of class POSIXct or POSIXt. This vector
indicates the timings of the end of each measurement in local time. Any
interval (typically 15 to 60 min) is allowed, but the timestamps must be
equally spaced and arranged chronologically.}

\item{vctr_dt}{A vector of dT (the temperature difference between sap flow
probes, in degrees Celsius) time series. The length of the vector must
match that of the timestamp vector. Missing values must be gap-filled
previously.}

\item{vctr_radi}{A vector of global solar radiation or a similar radiative
variable time series. The length of the vector must match that of the
timestamp vector. Missing values must be gap-filled previously. The unit of
the time series must match that of `thres_radi`.}

\item{vctr_ta}{A vector of air temperature (degrees Celsius) time series.
The length of the vector must match that of the timestamp vector. Missing
values must be gap-filled previously. The unit of the time series must
match that of `thres_ta`.}

\item{vctr_vpd}{A vector of vapor pressure deficit (VPD, in hPa) time
series. The length of the vector must match that of the timestamp vector.
Missing values must be gap-filled previously. The unit of the time series
must match that of `thres_vpd`.}

\item{thres_radi}{A threshold value of the radiation to define daytime.
Default is 100 (W m-2). The data points with radiation values above the
threshold are considered daytime values. The unit of the threshold must
match that of the input radiation time series.}

\item{thres_ta}{A threshold value of the air temperature to define predawn.
Default is 1.0 (degrees Celsius). The dTmax, estimated by the PD method,
with air temperature values below the threshold, is selected as a candidate
for the final dTmax. The unit of the threshold must match that of the input
air temperature time series.}

\item{thres_vpd}{A threshold value of the VPD to define predawn. Default is
1.0 (hPa). The dTmax, estimated by the PD method, with VPD values below the
threshold, is selected as a candidate for the final dTmax. The unit of the
threshold must match that of the input VPD time series.}

\item{thres_cv}{A threshold value of the coefficient of variation (CV) to
define predawn. Default is 0.005. The dTmax, estimated by the PD method,
with CV values below the threshold, is selected as a candidate for the
final dTmax.}

\item{thres_hour_pd}{An integer from 0 to 23. The threshold hour of the day
which defines the end of predawn in local time (default is 8).}

\item{min_n_wndw_dtmax}{A positive integer indicating the minimum number of
data points for calculating statistics using a moving window (default is
3). If the number of data points is less than this threshold, the
statistics are not calculated in the window.}

\item{output_daily}{A boolean. If `TRUE`, returns dTmax time series in daily
steps; else, returns dTmax in the original time steps. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\description{
`calc_dtmax_pd_ed()` calculates the time series of dTmax (the
 maximum temperature difference between sap flow probes under zero-flow
 conditions) using the daily predawn and the environmental dependent methods.
