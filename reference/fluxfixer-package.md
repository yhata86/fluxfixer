# fluxfixer: Advanced Framework for Sap Flow Data Post-Process

Provides a flexible framework for post-processing thermal dissipation
sap flow data using statistical methods and machine learning. This
framework includes anomaly correction, outlier removal, gap-filling,
trend removal, signal damping correction, and sap flux density
calculation. The functions in this package can also apply to other time
series with various artifacts.
